### Governance & Hybrid SDLC Overview

Water-Scrum-Fall model · Enterprise compliance pillars

This organization operates a **Hybrid SDLC model** — colloquially referred to as Water-Scrum-Fall — which strategically combines the iterative velocity of Agile/Scrum for software execution with the structured oversight of Waterfall for governance and production releases.

🔭 Waterfall — Initiation

Formal business case, governance approval gates, budget allocation (Tờ trình), and regulatory sign-off before any development begins.

⚡ Agile — Execution

Iterative Sprints, continuous integration, feature team backlogs, and Scrum ceremonies to deliver working software incrementally.

🔐 Waterfall — Release

Sequential Security & Performance testing gates, CAB review, mandatory regulatory audit checkpoints, and controlled production deployment.

🛡️ Regulated Delivery Compliance Pillars

As mandated by applicable regulations & internal policy

No single individual may hold conflicting roles across development, testing, and production deployment. Enforced via RBAC in GitHub, JIRA, and the production pipeline.

ℹ️

Developers **cannot** merge their own code to main. Testers must be independent. Release Managers hold sole authority to initiate production deployments.

| Role | Dev | Test | Release | PROD Access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Developer | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| QA / Tester | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Release Manager | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Read-only |
| DevOps Engineer | ❌ | ❌ | Support | ✅ |

All systems handling sensitive business data or customer PII must pass the security assessment cycle required by release policy:

- 1 SAST — automated scan on every commit via SonarQube + GitHub Advanced Security (CodeQL).

- 2 DAST — executed in SIT/UAT environment via OWASP ZAP.

- 3 Penetration Testing — performed by the independent Internal Security team.

- 4 Vulnerability Assessment Report — signed off before CAB submission.

⚠️

Any finding that meets the policy-defined security threshold is a **hard blocker**. The release cannot proceed until remediated, re-tested, or handled through the approved exception process.

The CAB is the final governance authority before any change reaches production. Membership includes Technology Leadership, Risk Management, Compliance, and Business Owners.

📅

CAB Frequency

Set by the organization’s release policy. Define a separate emergency-CAB response target for P1 incidents.

📄

Change Request (CR)

Must include PT Report, Security Report, UAT sign-off, rollback plan, deployment timeline.

🗳️

Voting Quorum

Set the quorum and approval threshold in the CAB charter, with stricter authority for Tier 1 systems.

⏳

Freeze Windows

No releases during approved freeze windows or regulatory reporting periods.

👤 View by Role — Duties & Responsibilities

📋

Release Manager

Owns the end-to-end release lifecycle. Single point of accountability for production deployment.

Pre-Deployment Duties

- Create and manage the Release Request in JIRA with full scope definition and changelog.

- Coordinate environment provisioning with DevOps for PERF and SEC environments.

- Confirm artifact build integrity (SHA checksum) and deployment package completeness.

- Track gate-passing across all 12 pipeline steps; escalate blockers immediately.

- Compile the Change Request package: PT Report, Security Report, UAT sign-off, Impact Analysis, Rollback Plan.

- Present the Change Request at the CAB meeting; answer all board queries.

- Conduct the Go/No-Go call with DevOps, Business Owner, and on-call support before PROD.

- Publish release notes and notify all stakeholders upon successful deployment.

- Manage the policy-defined post-release watch period and coordinate the Lessons Learned session.

📌

The Release Manager is the **only role** authorized to transition the pipeline at Steps 1→2, 5→6, and 10→11. These require explicit sign-off entries in the GRC system.

📊

Performance Tester

Responsible for validating system throughput, latency, and stability under peak enterprise load.

Performance Testing Duties

- Confirm PERF environment topology matches PROD specifications (CPU, RAM, DB replication).

- Design and execute **Load Test**: simulate peak concurrent users from production metrics.

- Execute **Stress Test**: push system to 150% of expected peak load to identify breaking point.

- Execute **Soak Test**: sustain load for minimum 4 hours to detect memory leaks or connection pool exhaustion.

- Capture KPIs: TPS, P95/P99 latency, error rate, CPU/memory utilization.

- Validate all KPIs against SLA thresholds defined in the Performance Test Plan.

- Generate the **Performance Test Report** using the approved organization template, including Grafana/JMeter screenshots.

- Obtain sign-off from Performance Test Lead and submit report to Release Manager.

⚠️

If any KPI fails its approved SLA threshold, the release is immediately blocked. Dev team notified for remediation before re-testing.

🔐

Security Tester

Independent security team responsible for identifying vulnerabilities before production exposure.

Security Testing Duties

- Review SAST findings from CI pipeline; confirm all High/Critical are remediated by Dev.

- Execute **DAST scan** using OWASP ZAP against the SEC environment.

- Conduct **manual penetration testing** covering OWASP Top 10 and enterprise-specific vectors.

- Assess **authentication & authorization** controls: MFA, RBAC enforcement, token expiry.

- Review **data encryption** at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+, AES-256 for PII fields).

- Validate **API security**: rate limiting, input validation, SQL injection, XSS prevention.

- Score all findings using **CVSS v3.1**; classify by Severity and Business Impact.

- Generate the **Security Assessment Report**; obtain CISO sign-off before releasing to RM.

🚨

**Hard Blocker:** Findings that meet the approved severity or control threshold automatically block deployment. The designated security authority has the blocking and exception authority defined by release policy.

- Smoke Test & Verification

- Release Manager executes the smoke-test checklist. Business Owner validates core business flows in PROD.

- Handover Meeting

- Formal handover with Ops Lead. All artifacts transferred. On-call duties activated.

- Organization-Defined Watch Period

- Set the standby duration and monitoring cadence in the release plan. P1/P2 triggers an immediate war-room.

- Project Closure

- Lessons Learned session. PIR report published. Project formally closed in PPM tool.

🖥️ Executable Runbook — Production Deploy & Rollback

Step-by-step, reproducible procedure the on-call engineer follows during the maintenance window. Every step has an owner and a verification.

▶ Deploy sequence

- 1**Pre-flight (T-15m):** confirm CAB approval ID & window; freeze other changes; announce in #release channel. Verify: Go decision logged in GRC.

- 2**Backup:** snapshot DB + capture current image tag/commit SHA as ROLLBACK_REF. Verify: backup restorable, SHA recorded.

- 3**Progressive deploy:** deploy via **canary** (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%) or **blue-green** (deploy green, keep blue warm). Verify: health checks green at each step.

- 4**DB migration:** run backward-compatible migration first (expand); defer destructive changes (contract) to a later release. Verify: migration exit code 0.

- 5**Smoke test:** run the PROD smoke checklist (login, one core business flow, one integration). Verify: all pass; error rate & P95 within SLO.

- 6**Cutover & confirm:** route 100% traffic; Business Owner validates core flow. Verify: Go/No-Go call → "released"; publish release note.

↩️

**Rollback triggers (any → roll back immediately):** P1 incident; error rate breaches the approved threshold; P95 latency exceeds SLA on core APIs; failed smoke test; data-integrity anomaly. **Rollback owner:** Release Manager decides, DevOps executes.

◀ Rollback sequence

- 1**Declare:** RM declares rollback; open incident; notify CAB chair (retro-approval).

- 2**Revert app:** blue-green → switch traffic back to blue; canary → scale new version to 0, restore ROLLBACK_REF. Verify: old version serving.

- 3**Revert data (if needed):** apply down-migration or restore snapshot. Verify: reconciliation check passes. (Expand/contract avoids this in most cases.)

- 4**Confirm & postmortem:** re-run smoke test on restored version; log timeline; schedule blameless postmortem with Ops/SRE.

🔗

Runtime auto-rollback on SLO breach & incident lifecycle are owned by the Operations & SRE Runbook; this section covers the **planned** release/rollback decision.

📊 Monitoring & Incident Response Framework

🟢

P4 — Low

Cosmetic issue. No business impact. Respond per incident policy.

🔵

P3 — Medium

Minor disruption. Workaround available. Respond per incident policy; assign L2.

🟡

P2 — High

Significant impact. No workaround. Respond per incident policy; engage L3 + Dev.

🔴

P1 — Critical

Core service unavailable. Meet the incident-policy response target, open a war-room, notify the CTO & business owner, and consider rollback.
